## Emotion Detection using CNN and FER-2013 Dataset

This project focuses on developing an emotion detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on the FER-2013 dataset. The FER-2013 dataset, which contains 35,887 grayscale, 48x48 pixel images of faces, each labeled with one of seven emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral), is used to train the CNN model to accurately classify emotions from facial expressions. The model architecture, data preprocessing techniques, and evaluation metrics are meticulously designed to achieve high accuracy in emotion recognition.

Trained models:

1. Build a CNN Artitecture from Scratch
2. Build a CNN appliying Tranfer Learning usign VGG16 CNN Arch.
3. Lastly Build Model using Resnet50-V2 and Achieved a approx of 60% accuracy.
